A starter web project powered by webpack

## Instructions
After you clone or download this repository from GitHub, run the following to install required NPM packages. You only need to do this once.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the following to start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser (Chrome and/or Firefox are recommended) to view your site. With the development server running, any change you make is compiled and seen automatically in the browser.

**NOTE**: All your HTML/CSS/Javascript code should go into the correct folders/files under the `src` folder and not under `dist` folder. 

When you are done with development and ready to deploy your application, run the following command:
project from `src` to `dist`:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will compile your application into the `dist` folder. It's the contents of this folder that you upload to the weber server for final deployment.
